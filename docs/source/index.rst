Welcome to PiArgus' documentation!
==================================

This package provides a python wrapper around `τ-ARGUS <https://research.cbs.nl/casc/tau.htm>`_, a program to protect statistical tables.
This package takes care of generating all the required metadata and runs τ-ARGUS in the background to do the heavy work.

For this package to work, it is required to install τ-ARGUS locally first.
It's also recommended to read the `TauArgus manual <https://research.cbs.nl/casc/Software/TauManualV4.1.pdf>`_ to understand some of the underlying concepts used in this package.
